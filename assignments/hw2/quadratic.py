Write the function weighted_average(in_file_name, out_file_name). This function accepts parameters that are strings relating to the input file’s name and the output file’s name.   This function should compute and output to the output file each student's average, using the formula given above. It should also output the overall average. Format all averages to one decimal place. Note that when calculating the overall average, m    print("the roots are", root1, root2)
